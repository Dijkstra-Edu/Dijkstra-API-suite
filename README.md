# Dijkstra - A one Stop Solution for all your CompSci educational needs!
  Dijkstra aims to solve developmental issues within the Student Community of Tier-2 and Tier-3 Colleges in India in the field of Computer Science by: 
 - Bringing students together and creating a community for all who are passionate about learning computer science but are not sure how to go about it. Dijkstras application provides a community that is open-source by nature. It is run by students, for students, and provides a safe space for learning, collaboration, and mentorship, irrespective of who you are. 
 - Defining a clear path to success, be it with improving fundamentals like data structures and algorithms, networks, operating systems, etc. for clearing interviews at big tech companies, Developmental knowledge to be work-ready in the industry and soft skills to get students within the community ready on all fronts for a career in tech. 
 - Building an environment for students to actively hone their developmental skills in real time via the open-source development of Dijstra. Students will be able to get real-time work experience by collaborating on the development of Dijkstra. This would include skills in full-stack development, micro-services development, cloud services, etc. All of which will be made available for students to access and work on. In simple terms, Dijkstra aims to be a one-stop solution for any aspiring CS student to become work-ready  
  
 We're currently looking for passionate students and Open-Source Developers for the following:
- Application Development (MERN stack)
- Web Development (MERN stack)
- Discord Moderators
- UI/UX Designers
- Content Writers
- Educators

# Development

### Server - Node (Use Version: v18.14.2)

After installing node (see node version), Begin by installing node dependencies.
```bash
npm i 
```

Start server
```bash
npm start
```

Other important tips to note:
```bash
API Creation:
----------------------------------------------------
Controller -> Contains req/res of API
Routers -> Contains route for API (in case of CreatePost, gets variable from controllers/post)
Models -> Conatains DB Schema for API calls
App.js -> Uses API call via app.use() function call (line 10, app.js)
```

Check out our [official documentation]() for more information about our [recommended hosting stack]() & properly [Updating Dijkstra](), plus work with [our API]().
